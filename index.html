            <span class="animate" style="--i:3;"></span>
            </div>
            <p>This is Rohit and I am a Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student with a passion for front-end
                development. Currently, I am working as a front-end developer, where I combine my technical skills and
                creative mindset to build visually appealing and user-friendly websites and applications.

                As a CSE student, I have a solid foundation in programming languages and concepts, which enables me to
                write clean and efficient code. I have a strong grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the
                building blocks of front-end development. I enjoy the process of turning design mockups and wireframes
                into fully functional and interactive user interfaces.

                Being a front-end developer allows me to leverage my eye for design and aesthetics. I have a keen
                attention to detail, ensuring that every element on the screen is pixel-perfect and visually engaging. I
                take pride in creating seamless and intuitive user experiences that enhance the overall usability of a
                website or application.

                            <p>During my teenage years, I had the opportunity to explore my passion for Computer Science, which ultimately set the foundation for my educational and professional journey. It all began when I completed my Class 10 from APS Bangalore, where my interest in the field was sparked.

                                At APS Bangalore, I had the privilege of being exposed to a well-rounded education that included computer science as a subject. It was during these classes that I realized the power and potential of technology. I found myself captivated by the world of computers, programming, and the endless possibilities they offered.
                                
                                What initially started as a curiosity quickly developed into a deep passion. I would spend countless hours exploring computer-related topics, reading books and online resources, and experimenting with programming languages. It was a thrilling experience to see lines of code come to life and witness how they could solve problems and create amazing digital experiences.
                                
                                I also actively participated in coding competitions and events, where I had the chance to showcase my skills and learn from other talented individuals. These experiences further fueled my enthusiasm for Computer Science and motivated me to pursue it as a career path.</p>

                            <p>During my last year at APS Bangalore, I had the incredible opportunity to focus on my passion for cricket while completing my Class 12 education. Cricket has always held a special place in my heart, and I dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to honing my skills and pursuing excellence in the sport.

                                Being part of the school cricket team was an exhilarating experience. It provided me with a platform to showcase my talent, develop teamwork and leadership skills, and learn important life lessons such as discipline, perseverance, and sportsmanship.
                                
                                Balancing my academic commitments with cricket was a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. I recognized the importance of maintaining a balance between my studies and my passion for the sport. It taught me valuable time management skills and the ability to prioritize and focus on both academic and extracurricular pursuits.
                                
                                I vividly recall the countless hours of practice on the field, working on my batting technique, bowling variations, and fielding skills. Every match was an opportunity for me to challenge myself, learn from my mistakes, and grow as a cricketer. The camaraderie and support of my teammates created a sense of unity and shared purpose, making the experience even more enjoyable.</p>
